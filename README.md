This package mainly contains a plotting function `ggseg3d` and
data.frames of different brain atlases for plotting. Plotting results of
analyses on regions or networks often involves swapping between
statistical tools, like R and Matlab, and software for brain imaging to
correctly visualise analysis results.

This package aims to make it possible to plot results directly through
R.

## Atlases

There are currently four atlases available in the package:

1.  `dk_3d` - Desikan-Killiany atlas (aparc).  
2.  `aseg_3d` - Automatic sub-cortical segmentation.

If you want to create your own custom atlas or discover other compatible
atlases, please see the companion package
[ggsegExtra](https://ggseg.github.io/ggsegExtra/).

## Installation

We recommend installing {ggsegExtra} through the ggseg r-universe.

``` r
# Enable this universe
options(repos = c(
    ggseg = 'https://ggseg.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install some packages
install.packages('ggsegExtra')
```

The package can be installed using {remotes}. The package includes some
large datasets for the brain coordinates. Please be patient during
download and install, it will take some time.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ggseg/ggseg3d", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The functions are now installed, and you may load them when you want to
use them. All functions are documented in standard R fashion.

## Use

The package also has a vignette, to help you get started using it. You
can access it
[here](https://ggseg.github.io/ggseg3d/articles/ggseg3d.html), or via R:

``` r
library(ggseg3d)
vignette("ggseg3d")
```

``` r
p <- ggseg3d(atlas=dk_3d) %>% 
  remove_axes() %>% 
  pan_camera("right lateral")
```

``` r
p <- ggseg3d(atlas=aseg_3d) %>% 
  add_glassbrain() %>% 
  remove_axes() %>% 
  pan_camera("right lateral")
```

### Report bugs or requests

Donâ€™t hesitate to ask for support using [github
issues](https://github.com/ggseg/ggseg3d/issues), or requesting new
atlases. While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you
may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to
it.
